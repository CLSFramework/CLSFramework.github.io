PY2D Soccer Simulation Base Code is a base code for RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation teams, which is written in Python.
This base code is powered by the [Cross Language Soccer Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05621), which allows you to create a team by using any programming language that supports gRPC or Thrift.
This base code uses `Helios Base` as a proxy to communicate with the RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation server.
PY2D base is the most power full base code for RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation which developed in Python.

For more information, please refer to the [documentation](https://clsframework.github.io/).

You can find more information about the services and messages in the [IDL section](../../3-idl/protobuf.md).

there are many different ways to run the base code, in the next section, we will explain the easiest way to run the base code.

## Quick start

### Preparation

Install the pre-requisites using the command below:

``` Bash
sudo apt-get install fuse #Used to run AppImages (Proxy, Monitor and RoboCup Server)
```

Clone this repository & install the required python libraries (such as gRPC). Don't forget to activate your virtual environment!

``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/CLSFramework/py2d.git
cd py2d
# Activate venv/anaconda before this step!
pip install -r requirements.txt

./generate.sh # Generate the gRPC files
```

To download RoboCup Soccer 2D Server using the commands below:

``` Bash
pushd scripts
sh download-rcssserver.sh # Download the soccer simulation server
popd
```

Next, download the soccer proxy, which uses C++ to read and pre-processes state data and passes them to the Python server (this project) for decision-making.

``` Bash
pushd scripts
sh download-proxy.sh #install C++ proxy
popd
```

Finally, to watch the game, download the monitor from [the original repository](https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssmonitor/releases) in order to view the games.

### Running a game

This section assumes you have installed the server & proxy using the scripts (as mentioned above).

To run a game, you must first run the RoboCup Soccer Server, then your team and opponent team, and finally the monitor.

We must first run a RoboCup Server, in order to host the game:

| Running the RoboCup Soccer Server

``` Bash
cd scripts/rcssserver
./rcssserver
```

| Running your team

We must run the proxy, and rpc server, you can run `start.py` or `start.sh` to run both the proxy and the server.

``` Bash
python3 start.py
// or
./start.sh
```

This script, by default, will run a gRPC server on port 50051, and 12 proxy agents (11 players and 1 coach). In each cycle of the game, the soccer server sends the state of the game to the proxy, which processes the state, creates state message and sends it to the rpc server. The rpc server receives the state message, processes it, and sends the actions to the proxy. The proxy receives the actions, processes them, and sends the commands to the soccer server.

| Running the opponent team

You can download an opponent team binary from the [RoboCup Soccer Simulation Repository](https://archive.robocup.info/Soccer/Simulation/2D/binaries/RoboCup/) for example `CYRUS` team from [here](https://archive.robocup.info/Soccer/Simulation/2D/binaries/RoboCup/2023/Day4/CYRUS_SS2D_RC2023_D4_BIN.tar.gz). After extracting the binary, you can run the team using the command below:

``` Bash
cd CYRUS_SS2D_RC2023_D4_BIN/bin
./start.sh
```

| Running the monitor

To watch the game, you must run the rcssmonitor or soccerwindow2. press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to connect to the server, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> for kick-off!

## Why & How it works

Originally the RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation teams used C++, as the main code base (Agent2D aka Helios Base) was written in this language due to its performance.
Due to the popularity of python in Machine Learning & AI spaces we decided to create a python platform which would be equivalent to Agent 2D.
However, using python alone was too slow as preprocessing sensor information & tasks such as localization took too long.

For this reason we have split up the code into two segments:
The data processing section in proxy, which creates a World Model (state), and passes it to python for planning to occur. This repository uses gRPC to pass along the World Model, but there is a sister-repo which is compatible with thrift.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SS as SoccerSimulationServer
    participant SP as SoccerSimulationProxy
    participant PM as PlayMakerServer
    Note over SS,PM: Run
    SP->>SS: Connect
    SS->>SP: OK, Unum
    SP->>PM: Register
    PM->>SP: OK, ClientID
    SS->>SP: Observation
    Note over SP: Convert observation to State
    SP->>PM: State
    PM->>SP: Actions
    Note over SP: Convert Actions to Low-Level Commands
    SP->>SS: Commands
```

As seen in the figure, the proxy handles connecting to the server, receiving sensor information and creating a world-model, and finds the action to take via a remote procedure call to a decision-making server, which is this repository.

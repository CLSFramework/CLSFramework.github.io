Developing a team can be complex due to the environment's intricacy, typically necessitating C++ programming. However, our framework allows for development in other languages by leveraging the [helios-base](https://github.com/helios-base/helios-base) features. By using **SoccerSimulationProxy**, you can develop a team in any language supported by **gRPC** or **Thrift**, such as **C#, C++, Dart, Go, Java, Kotlin, Node.js, Objective-C, PHP, Python, and Ruby**.

To use **gRPC**, you can check out our [gRPC server](../2-sampleserver/0-sample-python-base-code-gRPC/index.md), which is based on proto messages and gRPC services. This server provides a helpful base to get more familiar with the gRPC implementation. 

To use **Thrift**, you can check out our [thrift server](../2-sampleserver/1-sample-python-base-code-thrift/index.md), which is based on proto messages and thrift services. This server provides a helpful base to get more familiar with the thrift implementation.

You can find more information about the services and messages in the [IDL section](../3-idl/protobuf.md).

## Work Flow

This allows you to focus on developing your team's strategy and AI algorithms without worrying about the server's underlying complexity.

If you would like to develop a team or conduct research using **Python**, **C#**, or **JavaScript**, you can check the following links:

- [Playmaker-Server-Python-grpc](../2-sampleserver/0-sample-python-base-code-gRPC/index.md)
- [Playmaker-Server-Python-thrift](../2-sampleserver/1-sample-python-base-code-thrift/index.md)
- [Playmaker-Server-CSharp](https://github.com/CLSFramework/playmaker-server-csharp)
- [Playmaker-Server-NodeJs](https://github.com/CLSFramework/playmaker-server-nodejs)

This new base code is powered by Helios-Base and gRPC, designed to assist researchers in developing a Soccer Simulation 2D team or conducting research in this area. It supports development in any language compatible with gRPC.
## How To Use it?

To use this framework, follow the steps below in order:

### 1 - Start the **rcssserver**
The **rcssserver** hosts the game. You can follow the instructions for setting it up in the [soccersimulation server](./../5-soccersimulation/0-server/index.md).

### 2 - Run the **Playmaker-Server**
Next, run one of the sample Playmaker Servers, such as this [gRPC Server](../2-sampleserver/0-sample-python-base-code-gRPC/index.md), to receive information from the agents and send appropriate actions back to the game.

### 3 - Set up the **Soccer Simulation Proxy**
Now, run the **Soccer Simulation Proxy** to connect to the **rcssserver** and handle information exchange between agents and the server. You can do this using AppImage, Docker, or by building from source. 

Here, weâ€™ll explain how to run the Soccer Simulation Proxy using AppImage and build from the source.

### 4.1 - Use **AppImage**

#### 1. Download the AppImage
 You can download the AppImage from the [release page](https://github.com/CLSFramework/soccer-simulation-proxy/releases) or use the following command to download the latest version:
   ```bash
   wget $(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/clsframework/soccer-simulation-proxy/releases/latest" | grep -oP '"browser_download_url": "\K[^"]*' | grep "soccer-simulation-proxy.tar.gz")
   ```
#### 2. Extract the AppImage
After downloading, extract the tar.gz file:
```bash
tar -xvf soccer-simulation-proxy.tar.gz
```
#### 3. Run the Proxy
After downloading, you can run the proxy:
```bash
cd SoccerSimulationProxy
./start.sh
```
If you want to connect the proxy to a grpc server change this parameter to `grpc` in start.sh file.
```bash
rpc_type="thrift"
```
#### 4. Watch the Game
To watch the game, you can use either of the following:

- **[rcssmonitor](https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssmonitor)**: A tool to visualize the game.
- **[SoccerWindow2](https://github.com/helios-base/soccerwindow2)**: Another visualization tool for RoboCup Soccer Simulation.

For instructions on how to run **rcssmonitor**, check the [rcssmonitor](../5-soccersimulation/1-monitor/index.md) or [soccer window 2](../5-soccersimulation/2-soccerwindow/index.md).



### 4.2 - Build from **source, install, and run (Linux, WSL)**

To build the soccer simulation proxy, you need to install the following dependencies:

#### 1. LibRCSC

```bash
git clone git@github.com:helios-base/librcsc.git
cd librcsc
git checkout 19175f339dcb5c3f61b56a8c1bff5345109f22ef
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

#### 2. gRPC - follow the instructions provided in the [repository](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/cpp/quickstart/)

```bash
export MY_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local
mkdir -p $MY_INSTALL_DIR
export PATH="$MY_INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH"
sudo apt install -y build-essential autoconf libtool pkg-config
git clone --recurse-submodules -b v1.62.0 --depth 1 --shallow-submodules https://github.com/grpc/grpc
cd grpc/
mkdir -p cmake/build
pushd cmake/build
cmake -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON       -DgRPC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF       -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MY_INSTALL_DIR       ../..
make -j 4
make install
```

then, add the following lines at the end of $HOME/.bashrc

```bash
export MY_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local
export PATH="$MY_INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH"
```

then, run the following command

```bash
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

To test grpc, go to grpc directory (in this example it is in $HOME/grpc) and run the following commands:

```bash
cd examples/cpp/helloworld
mkdir -p cmake/build
cd cmake/build/
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$MY_INSTALL_DIR ../..
make
run ./greeter_server in one tab
run ./greeter_client in another tab
```

#### 3. SoccerSimulationProxy

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CLSFramework/soccer-simulation-proxy.git
cd soccer-simulation-proxy
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


#### 4. Run Soccer Simulation Proxy

To run the Soccer Simulation Proxy, you can use the following command: (You should run the Soccer Simulation Server and a PlayMaker Server before running the Soccer Simulation Proxy)

```bash
cd build/bin
./start.sh
```

To run the Soccer Simulation Proxy in debug mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd build/bin
./start-debug.sh
```

#### 5. Watch the Game
To watch the game, you can use either of the following:

- **[rcssmonitor](https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssmonitor)**: A tool to visualize the game.
- **[SoccerWindow2](https://github.com/helios-base/soccerwindow2)**: Another visualization tool for RoboCup Soccer Simulation.

For instructions on how to run **rcssmonitor**, check the [rcssmonitor](../5-soccersimulation/1-monitor/index.md) or [soccer window 2](../5-soccersimulation/2-soccerwindow/index.md).

To use the **CLSFramework**, you need two additional components:

- **Soccer Simulation Server**  
   - This is the core server [`rcssserver`](/docs/5-soccersimulation/0-server/index.md) that connects the agents and runs the simulation.

- **Monitor**  
   - A monitor is used to visualize the game. You can use either[`rcssmonitor`](/docs/5-soccersimulation/1-monitor/index.md) or [`soccerwindow2`](/docs/5-soccersimulation/2-soccerwindow/index.md) for this purpose.
